This study explores the use of Explainable AI (XAI), specifically SHAP, to analyze a cyclist's cognitive workload during urban mapping. It focuses on three cognitive states: ID Glance (eye movement behaviors), Meditation (mental relaxation), and Attention (cognitive focus). The dataset includes EEG readings, GPS data, and urban features, providing insights into how motion and environmental factors affect cognitive workload. SHAP helps interpret the impact of these factors on human decision-making, enhancing model transparency and trust in AI predictions.
