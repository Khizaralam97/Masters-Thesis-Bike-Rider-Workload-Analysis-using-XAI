# Masters_Thesis_Bike_Rider_Workload_Analysis_using_XAI
This study applies Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP to analyze a cyclist’s cognitive workload during urban mapping tasks. The research focuses on three cognitive states—ID Glance, Meditation, and Attention—using EEG, GPS, and geographic data to assess the impact of motion and environmental factors on cognitive workload.
