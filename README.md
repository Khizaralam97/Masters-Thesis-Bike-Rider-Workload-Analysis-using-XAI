This study explores the in-depth analysis of cyclists' cognitive workload during urban navigation using EEG signals, GPS tracking, and environmental features. Applied Explainable AI techniques, particularly SHAP, to interpret the influence of spatial and motion-based variables on cognitive states such as ID Glance (visual attention), Meditation (mental relaxation), and Attention (focus). Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to enhance model transparency and support human-centered AI insights.
